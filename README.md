# Website

This repository contains a minimal website that can be hosted using GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, using the main branch.
3. Visit the generated GitHub Pages URL to see the site.

The main content is in `index.html`. Selecting a surface in AR now loads a GLB
model from `https://illusiontechnique.com/xr/unicorn/assets/Unicorn_00.glb`.
