# Website

This repository contains a minimal website that can be hosted using GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, using the main branch.
3. Visit the generated GitHub Pages URL to see the site.

The main content is in `index.html`. AR cube placement is enabled by default and a simple HUD lets you load a custom `.glb` model instead of the cube.
